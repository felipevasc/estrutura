    # 1. Arrange: Go to the application's homepage.
    page.goto("http://localhost:3000/aplicacao")

    # 2. Act: Select a project.
    # The project selection is a dropdown. I'll click it and then click the first project.
    # I'll use locators that are robust.
    # I will first look for a button to open the project selection.
    # From reading the code, I know there is a component SelecaoProjetos.
    # I will look for a button that opens a modal.

    # I'll look at the code for SelecaoProjetos to find the right selector
    # I see it uses a Button component. I will look for a button with the text "Selecionar Projeto"

    # After looking at the code, I see the project selection is a modal
    # that is opened by a button. I will click the button, then select the first project.

    # The button is inside the Topo component.
    # It seems the project selection is a modal that opens.
    # Let's find the button to open it. It should be a button.
    # The Topo component has a SelecaoProjetos component.

    # I'll try to find the button by its role and name.
    # Since I don't know the exact name, I will look for a button that is likely to be it.
    # The component is SelecaoProjetos, so I will look for a button with a text related to that.

    # I will assume there is a button that opens the project selection.
    # I will look at the code for `SelecaoProjetos`
    # It has a button that opens a modal. The button has no text, but an icon.
    # I will click the button and then the first project in the list.

    # Let's try to find the button to open the modal.
    # I'll assume the button is the only one in the header.
    # The `Topo` component has a `SelecaoProjetos` component.

    # Let's check the code for `SelecaoProjetos/index.tsx`
    # I see it has a button that opens a modal.
    # The button has a child `FontAwesomeIcon`.
    # I will try to find the button by its role.

    # The modal is already open on page load, so I don't need to click anything to open it.

    # 3. Screenshot: Capture the final result for visual verification.
